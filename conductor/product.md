# XRD Analyzer

## Product Vision
A modern, web-based XRD (X-ray Diffraction) analysis tool designed to provide researchers and students with a streamlined workflow for visualizing, processing, and analyzing diffraction data directly in the browser.

## Primary Goals
- **User-Friendly Visualization:** Provide an intuitive interface for visualizing XRD data (2θ vs. Intensity) using high-performance interactive charts.
- **Advanced Data Processing:** Implement essential scientific algorithms including background subtraction and Savitzky-Golay smoothing to improve data quality.
- **Automated Analysis:** Enable efficient peak detection and phase identification to assist in material characterization.
- **Data Portability:** Support exporting processed data and high-resolution charts in standard formats (CSV, PNG) for research reports and further analysis.

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** Material Scientists and Researchers requiring a quick and accessible tool for data inspection and preliminary analysis.
- **Secondary:** Students and Lab Technicians in chemistry and physics departments.

## Core Features (MVP)
- **Robust File Handling:** Support for common scientific data formats (CSV, TXT, DAT) with intelligent parsing.
- **Interactive Plotting:** High-fidelity Plotly-based charts with built-in zoom, pan, and interactive tooltips.
- **Scientific Processing Suite:** Essential tools for background subtraction and data smoothing.
- **Peak Identification:** Automated peak detection with user-adjustable sensitivity and visual markers.

## Visual Identity
- **Modern & Clean:** A professional UI leveraging Material Design and shadcn/ui principles to ensure clarity and ease of use without compromising scientific depth.
