# Product Guidelines

## Tone & Voice
- **Professional & Precise:** The application should use accurate scientific terminology and maintain a formal, reliable tone. 
- **Trustworthy:** Language should emphasize precision and clarity, reflecting the rigorous nature of scientific research.

## Design Principles
- **Data-First Layout:** The primary XRD chart should be the centerpiece of the interface. Controls and metadata should support, not distract from, the visualization.
- **Clarity over Density:** Despite the complexity of XRD analysis, the UI should remain uncluttered. Use progressive disclosure (accordions, tabs) to reveal advanced settings only when needed.
- **Consistent Feedback:** Every user action (file upload, algorithmic processing, export) must provide immediate and clear visual feedback, including loading states and error notifications.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure high contrast for data traces and labels to maintain readability across different displays and for users with visual impairments.
